When you connect a VPN service, you establish an encrypted tunnel between your device and that server. Nobody can see what’s happening in the middle of this tunnel, not even your ISP.

And yet, it doesn’t make you magically anonymous. You’re just moving the risk down the VPN tunnel as the VPN company can see all your internet traffic. Many of them sell your data to scammers and advertisers already.

That’s why I don’t recommend signing up for a third-party VPN service. You can’t trust them.

But VPNs can be useful from time to time. You can access Geo-location restricted websites and bypass filters and restrictions of governments or even secure local traffic while surfing on public WiFi.

Implementing your own VPN server isn't as technical or difficult as it may sound.
